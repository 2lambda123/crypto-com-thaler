# ADR 003: Migrate to jellyfish merkle trie

## Changelog
* 02-04-2020: Initial Draft

## Context

Need a merkle trie library to store staking state, current one has several disadvantages:

- Written and maintained by single person.
- Custom data structure and algorithm.
- Not enough documentation.

## Decision

Choose [jellyfish merkle trie](https://github.com/libra/libra/blob/master/storage/jellyfish-merkle/src/lib.rs) as the
merkle trie solution.

#### Advantages

- Review from Facebook security engineers
- Small code base, well documented.
- Well known data structure (simplified version of ethereum MPT).
- Easy to integrate.
- Optimized for pbft: Use u64 version number instead of hash.
- License is apache 2.0.
- Support inclusion proof, exclusion proof and range proof.

Maintain a custom fork of libra repository, make nessesary changes to keep jellyfish-merkle separated from other part
of the project.

### Integration

- Add a column `COL_TRIE_NODE` to store trie nodes in the same key-value store as other states.

- Implement `jellyfish_merkle::TreeReader` for `GetKV`.

  ```rust
  struct KVReader<'a, S: GetKV>(&'a S);
  impl<'a, S: GetKV> TreeReader for KVReader<'a, S> {
      fn get_node_option(&self, node_key: &NodeKey) -> Result<Option<Node>> {
          self.0
              .get(&(COL_TRIE_NODE, node_key.encode()?))
              .map(|bytes| Node::decode(&bytes))
              .transpose()
      }
  
      fn get_rightmost_leaf(&self) -> Result<Option<(NodeKey, LeafNode)>> {
          unimplemented!("this feature is only used in merkle tree restore which we don't need yet");
      }
  }
  ```

- Implement `StakingGetter` with `JellyfishMerkleTree` against any `GetKV`,

  Use `BlockHeight` as the version number.
  
  ```rust
  pub struct StakingGetter<'a, S: GetKV> {
      storage: &'a S,
      block_height: BlockHeight,
  }
  
  impl<'a, S: GetKV> Get for StakingGetter<'a, S> {
      type Key = StakedStateAddress;
      type Value = StakedState;
      fn get(&self, key: &Self::Key) -> Option<Self::Value> {
          JellyfishMerkleTree::new(&KVReader::new(self.storage))
              .get_with_proof(HashValue::new(to_stake_key(key)), self.block_height.into())
              .expect("merkle trie internal error")
              .0
              .map(|blob| {
                  StakedState::decode(&mut blob.as_ref()).expect("merkle trie storage corrupted")
              })
      }
  }
  ```
  
- Use the same buffer abstraction as before:
  
  ```rust
  pub type StakingBufferStore<'a, S, H> = BufferSimpleStore<'a, StakingGetter<'a, S>, H>;
  pub type StakingBufferGetter<'a, S, H> = BufferGetter<'a, StakingGetter<'a, S>, H>;
  ```
  
- When commit, flush the staking buffer into the Merkle trie, write the nodes into the `StoreKV`, which is the buffered
  key-value storage shared with other states.
  
  ```rust
  pub fn flush_stakings<S: StoreKV>(
      storage: &mut S,
      block_height: BlockHeight,
      buffer: StakingBuffer,
  ) -> Result<(usize, usize)> {
      let reader = KVReader::new(storage);
      let tree = JellyfishMerkleTree::new(&reader);
      let (_, batch) = tree.put_blob_sets(
          vec![buffer
              .values()
              .map(|staking| (HashValue::new(staking.key()), staking.encode().into()))
              .collect::<Vec<_>>()],
          block_height.into(),
      )?;
      for (key, node) in batch.node_batch.iter() {
          storage.set((COL_TRIE_NODE, key.encode()?), node.encode()?);
      }
      storage.set(
          (COL_STALED_NODE, block_height.encode()), 
          batch.stale_node_index_batch.encode()
      );
      Ok((batch.num_new_leaves, batch.num_stale_leaves))
  }
  ```
  
- A complete commit would be like this:
  
  ```rust
  flush_staking(&mut kv_store!(self), block_height, staking_buffer);
  flush_kv(&mut self.kvdb, kv_buffer);  // Write to the disk atomically.
  ```

### Chain node state changes

- Remove `AccountStorage` from `ChainNodeApp`.

- In `ChainState`, change `account_root` to `last_account_block_height`, which records the last block height there's any
  staking state modified.
  
  Use the block height to query history state directly.

### Staled nodes cleanup

When node is modified, the old version is staled. The keys of staled nodes are stored in column `COL_STALED_NODE`, indexed by the block height it's staled since.

In the future, we might want to prune the nodes too old based on this information.

### Implementation plan

One PR for each steps:

- Add jellyfish module in `chain-storage`, which implements all the integration groundworks mentioned above.
- Make the switch, and remove the starling based `AccountStorage`.

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

### Positive

- Better integration with buffer storage, single batch write operation for all the states when commit.
- Clear tree structure and argorithm.
- No need to store the root hash in chain state, and the block height to root hash mapping.

### Negative

- Need to track the upstream changes manually.

### Neutral

- Don't support fork because of the monotonically increasing version number, not an issue for tendermint.
